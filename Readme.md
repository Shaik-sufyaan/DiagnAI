## Proposition:
We can complement doctors: Making their lives efficient.
We can have patients get a better idea of their condition. A patient will only seek a doctor if they know something is wrong.
The model can be a regular companion of the user and can detect if something is wrong with the user.
We can take away the initial screening pressure from the medical industry so that they can just focus on saving lives. And we can let highly specialized LLM agents do the initial medical screening.
Regular therapies have a higher frequency than a therapist can provide.
24*7 availability
Understand diff languages?
Weâ€™ll discuss about it

## Execution:
### Dataset:
All major medical literature; a Medically accurate corpus of data
Real past therapies are practiced by real therapists
Past case studies
RAG with a good LLM
Real-time voice-to-voice interactions
Voice will not be robotic, but will in fact mimic the real therapist(we can talk to the doctor about it).
Real-time photorealistic face generation with facial expressions.
